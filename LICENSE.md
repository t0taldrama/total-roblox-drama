## 🛡️ Tips for Safer Use

Using any **total roblox drama script exploit** responsibly is what keeps your account safe long-term:

- **Use an alternate account** — never run an untested build on your main account first
- **Don't win every single round** — consistently perfect scores in public lobbies draw player reports; occasionally let a round play out naturally
- **Keep the script updated** — always use the latest release from the **total roblox drama script github** repo; outdated **total roblox drama script executor** builds are the leading cause of detection
- **Avoid visible exploiting** — flying openly above the map during challenges is obvious to other players; use fly mode sparingly in public servers
- **Use private servers for farming** — TP to coins and gems is safest in private sessions where no one can observe your movement patterns
- **Don't share your screen** — streaming or recording with the GUI visible creates evidence and violates Roblox ToS
- **Monitor the community** — our Discord posts real-time alerts about ban waves and anti-cheat updates so you can pause usage at high-risk moments
